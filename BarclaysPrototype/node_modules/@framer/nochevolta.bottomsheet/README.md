# Basic setup
1. Drag and drop the `BottomSheet` or `BottomSheetScroll` into your main frame.
2. **Connect it to the frame** that you want to use as content.
3. Edit the props controls accord your needs.
4. Select the main frame and active the Preview mode (⌘+P)
5. Drag it up/down ✨

⚠️ **To do scroll use the mouse wheel or two fingers on the trackpad**.

If you don't need to do scroll, use the `BottomSheet` component.
